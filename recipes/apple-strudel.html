    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This apple strudel is very easy to make with apples, raisins, and frozen puff pastry, yet it looks impressive and
        tastes amazing! A truly delicious fall dessert</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples: The tartness from Granny Smith apples perfectly balances the sweet brown sugar. </li>
        <li>Brown sugar: Opt for light brown sugar for the perfect sweet, cozy flavor.</li>
        <li>Golden raisins: Golden raisins take the flavor and texture up a few notches.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour thickens the apple strudel filling.</li>
        <li>Puff pastry: Two thawed puff pastry sheets are key to making this easy apple strudel. </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the strudel taste salty.</li>
        <li>Egg and milk: Brushing an egg wash (made with one egg and a tablespoon of whole milk) over the puff pastry before baking ensures a gorgeous golden brown finish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade apple strudel:</p>
